		<li class="dnt">The entire site has been updated to JavaScript's ES6 modules. The solitary script file was getting far too large so splitting it up just had to be done.</li>
		<li class="dnt">If the website won't work in a specific browser you now get a message telling you such.</li>
		<li class="dnt">While interacting with a layer on a touchscreen device the popups and context menus will now work correctly.</li>

	<ul class="list">
		<li class="dnt">You can now search for anything from a new menu. The search result can be sorted in a number of ways including my favourite, by distance, this creates a path through every result. Search results can be clicked which pans the map to that location. You can also search specifically by Type, Category, Content and Creator, this last one helps you to find your own layers.</li>
		<li class="dnt">You can now share layers and your search results, which adds a link to your clipboard.</li>
		<li class="dnt">There is now a context menu on all layers, this menu includes 'Search Similar', 'Share' and 'Complete' where applicable. There is also 'Settings', 'Edit' and 'Move' if you have access to do this.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Added a new setting to Markers so they can be cycled, this is better for Activities and the shared Resource Nodes which may be one of many taking up the same space.</li>
		<li class="dnt">All unsaved changes are now stored locally until you save them, this is persistent through disconnections, crashes and just forgetting to press save. Also with this there is also a cancel button, just in case you don't actually want to save your changes.</li>
		<li class="dnt">A bug has been fixed where switching a layer type from a layer with a popup to without would cause it to not remove the previous popup.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Now, when adding, removing or changing a layers type, the counts will be updated on the filter menu.</li>
		<li class="dnt">When duplicating a poly, as long as the type changes, it can now be left in the same place without automatically deleting.</li>
		<li class="dnt">You can now copy and paste layer positions, this is helpful for markers and their areas that are to be cycled.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Hiding Completed layers will now be persistent after reloading the page.</li>
		<li class="dnt">When editing a poly, if you also enable dragging, dragging will no longer work in edit mode. This stops it messing up the edit drag markers.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Cancel now resets a dragged layer back to it's original position.</li>
	</ul>

		<li class="dnt">Changed the way the World Tiers work, now all you have to do is complete the missions to progress, this automatically adjusts the mission descriptions, icons and levels of everything on the map. Basically it works the same as the game.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Added a few more settings to layers for the new World Tier switching to work correctly.</li>
		<li class="dnt">All Side Missions will now show when on World Tier Mode, in-case you didn't do them while in Story Mode.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Been back over a few zones adding all of the missing materials, consumables and loot. There is still a lot more to do, but I'm getting there. Slowly!</li>

		<li class="dnt">Upon zooming out, previously hidden markers will now change to coloured dots, these the dots appear one zoom level above when they would previously be hidden. These dots are still hover-able and easily identifiable by the colour in most cases.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Fixed the timers not ending as they should.</li>
		<li class="dnt">Timers are still timed from the click rather than the new patch change of the time of day that they refresh. We still need to get those.</li>

				<li class="dnt">complete some temporarily, as in the caches you can collect repeatedly.</li>
				<li class="dnt">the timed ones have a pre-set time which matches the in-game re-spawn.</li>
				<li class="dnt">some have linked layers, like the Resource Nodes which will mark all associated Resources.</li>
				<li class="dnt">the linked layers include the areas, which will show and hide along with the markers.</li>
			</ul>

		<li class="dnt">Not all layers have been set up to mark as complete as of yet and will take time.</li>
