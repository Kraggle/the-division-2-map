<ul>
	<li class="dnt">Upon zooming out, previously hidden markers will now change to coloured dots, these the dots appear one zoom level above when they would previously be hidden. These dots are still hoverable and easily identifiable by the color in most cases.</li>
	<li class="dnt">Fixed the timers not ending as they should.</li>
	<li class="dnt">Timers are still timed from the click rather than the new patch change of the time of day that they refresh. We still need to get those.</li>
	<li class="dnt">Fixed the Zone Category not showing again after hiding them all.</li>
	<li class="dnt">Most Collectables are now added and correctly described thanks to Engeloki.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li class="dnt">Improved load times by caching the bulk of the data and only downloading if it has changed.</li>
	<li class="dnt">Added descriptions to the settings in the tools.</li>
	<li class="dnt">You can now mark certain layers as complete by right clicking. With this you can...
		<ul>
			<li class="dnt">show and hide any that are complete.</li>
			<li class="dnt">complete some temporarily, as in the caches you can collect repeatedly.</li>
			<li class="dnt">the timed ones have a preset time which matches the in-game respawn.</li>
			<li class="dnt">some have linked layers, like the Resource Nodes which will mark all associated Resources.</li>
			<li class="dnt">the linked layers include the areas, which will show and hide along with the markers.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li class="dnt">Not all layers have been set up to mark as complete as of yet and will take time.</li>
	<li class="dnt">Thanks to Engeloki more markers have been added to the map and he has improved a lot of the popups.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li class="dnt">Initial upload!</li>
	<li class="dnt">Fully mapped the roads, buildings and paths and added a lot of the
		collectables, caches and points of interest for the following areas</li>

		<li class="dnt">White House</li>
		<li class="dnt">Downtown East</li>
		<li class="dnt">Federal Triangle</li>
		<li class="dnt">East Mall</li>

		to the map and actually mapping the areas not listed above, but we are getting
		there slowly.</li>
